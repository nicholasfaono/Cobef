      <p>In November 1999, a group of researchers and university professors supported the idea concerning a congress dedicated to manufacturing area, wondering whether its first edition could take place at Paraná, given that the implantation of new automobile pole in this state at this time. This idea was further explored during the 15th Brazilian Congress of Mechanical Engineering - COBEM, in November 1999, held at Águas de Lindóia - São Paulo. The official support from the Board of Directors of the Brazilian Society of Engineering and Mechanical Sciences (ABCM) and the beginning of a National Manufacturing Engineering Committee became fundamental motivations for the organization of the first congress.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In the meeting organized in February 2000 at Paraná Federal University (UFPR), attended by professors Álisson Rocha Machado (UFU), Sinésio Domingues Franco (UFU), José Divo Bressan (UDESC), Rolf Bertrand Schroeter (UFSC), Marcelo Teixeira dos Santos (SOCIESC), Paulo César Okimoto (UFPR), Dalberto Dias da Costa (UFPR), Walter Casas (UFPR), Ana Sofia D'Oliveira (UFPR), Paulo Victor Marcondes (UFPR), Ramon Cortes Paredes (UFPR), Silvio Brunatto (UFPR), Nixon Malveira (UFPR), Ossimar Maranho (CEFET-PR), Walter Luis Mikos (CEFET-PR), Milton Luiz Polli (CEFET-PR), Paulo André Beltrão (CEFET-PR), Ricardo Torres (PUC-PR), Gilmar Batalha (USP), Sérgio Tonini Button (UNICAMP) and Alexandre Mendes Abrão (UFMG), the proposal for the creation of the National Manufacturing Engineering Committee was submitted to the ABCM. The first accomplishment of the Manufacturing Engineering Committee was the proposal to the ABCM to promote the organization of the 1st Brazilian Congress on Manufacturing Engineering - COBEF, at Curitiba in April 2001. In this proposal, the following COBEF editions would be organized every two years.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The COBEF became a proper forum, in which people from industrials and academicals sectors discuss topics of their technological and scientific interests in agreement with the Brazilian and Global realities. Since its first edition, organized at Curitiba in 2001, the COBEF has become the most important Brazilian congress on Manufacturing Engineering, promoted at different Brazil locations, namely, Uberlândia, - MG, (2003), Joinville-SC (2005), Águas de São Pedro-SP(2007), Belo Horizonte-MG (2009), Caxias do Sul -RS (2011) and Penedo (2013).</p>
